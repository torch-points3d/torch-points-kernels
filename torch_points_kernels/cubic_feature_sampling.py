    r"""
    Sample the features of points from 3D feature maps that the point lies in.
    Please refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03761 for more information

    Parameters
    ----------
    ptcloud : torch.Tensor (dtype=torch.float32)
        (B, n_pts, 3) point clouds containing n_pts points
    cubic_features : torch.Tensor (dtype=torch.float32)
        (B, c, m, m, m) 3D feature maps of sizes m x m x m and c channels
    neighborhood_size : int
        The neighborhood cubes to sample.
        neighborhood_size = 1 means to sample the cube that point lies in.
        neighborhood_size = 2 means to sample surrouding cubes (step = 1) of
        the cube that point lies in.

    Returns
    -------
    dist: torch.Tensor
        (B, n_pts, n_vertices, c), where n_vertices = (neighborhood_size * 2)^3
